# lightning-strike-python

Lightning Detection using Python and OpenCV.

Basically its going to go through all the frames in the video and detect the frames that have lightning strikes. Then it puts all the processed data in a .csv file which you can use to further analyze for research purposes. Enjoy! ðŸ™‚

Instructions:
1. Input your <b>FULL</b> video file name, eg. myvideo.mp4 not only myvideo

2. Keep the program in a <b>SEPARATE</b> folder as it will generate alot of jpg files during processing.

For testing if it works run the test.mp4. Play around with the threshold value for better accuracy.

Data gets processed to a .csv file
